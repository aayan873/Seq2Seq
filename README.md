Sequence Models: RNN & LSTM
This repository contains simple PyTorch implementations of two fundamental sequence models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs). The project demonstrates their application in two distinct tasks: a Question-Answering (Q&A) system using an RNN and a text generation model for poetry using an LSTM.

üìÅ Files
100_Unique_QA_Dataset.csv: A custom dataset containing question-answer pairs for the Q&A model.

qna-using-rnn-pytorch.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook implementing an RNN-based model for the Q&A task.

poetry-generation-lstm.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook for the LSTM-based text/poetry generation model.

shakespeare.txt: A text dataset used for training the LSTM poetry generation model.
